## Description:

Learn how to let a user navigate from Home to Details (although we did learn how to change the initial route in our code, but forcing our users to clone our repository and change the route in our code in order to see another screen is arguably among the worst user experiences one could imagine).

### Installation:

1] Star and clone the repository to your machine.

2] Open Terminal on project

3] Run the command `npm i` For node >18  OR `npm install` For node <20

4] Run the command `react-native-run-android`

5] EnjoyðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‰

#### Packages (The packages are installed in this project and there is no need to install them again):

1] npm install @react-navigation/native

2] npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

3] npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
